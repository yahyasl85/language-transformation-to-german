# language-transformation-to-german
chat box for german language transformation
Project Description:

This project demonstrates a translation pipeline using the nllb-200-distilled-600M model from Facebook (Meta AI) within a Google Colab environment. The code utilizes the transformers library to load the model and tokenizer, along with langdetect to identify the language of the input text.

Key Functionalities:

Language Detection: The langdetect library is employed to automatically detect the language of a given input prompt.
Translation:
If the detected language is not English, the code uses the pipeline function from transformers to translate the text from German to English.
The pipeline can also translate English text to German if needed.
Model: The code use nllb-200-distilled-600M model for translation, which is a smaller version of the No Language Left Behind model.
Pipeline Integration: The translation process is streamlined using the pipeline function, simplifying the model's usage for text translation.
Flexibility: The pipeline is flexible enough to be used in both directions. From German to English or English to German.
Libraries Used:

transformers (for the translation model and tokenizer)
langdetect (for language detection)
Example Usage:

The code includes examples of translating both English and German sentences, showing the workflow.

How to run the code

Install necessary libraries using the following code.
 
!pip install langdetect transformers
Use code with caution
run all the code of the notebook in order.
Potential Improvements:

The project can be further improved by adding support for more languages.
The ability to handle text of different lengths can be improved.
Why This is Suitable for a Portfolio:

Demonstrates Practical Skills: It showcases your ability to integrate and use pre-trained models.
Clear Application: It addresses a real-world problem (text translation).
Organized and Readable Code: The provided code is well-structured and easy to follow.
Highlights Key Technologies: It demonstrates experience with popular libraries like transformers and langdetect.
